# üß† AI Prompt Templates

This folder contains the prompt engineering logic used to guide Gemini AI in generating quiz content from user-uploaded documents.

## üìÑ Files

### `gemini_prompts.py`
Contains the key prompt templates and formatting logic for:
- Extracting readable and quiz-relevant text from various file types (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Asking Gemini to generate multiple-choice and true/false questions from that content
- Asking Gemini to evaluate user answers and return both the correct option and a brief explanation

---

## üß™ Prompt Engineering Strategy

Gemini prompts are:
- Carefully structured to minimize ambiguity
- Tuned for factuality, clarity, and coverage
- Parameterized to support batch generation of 5-question sections per uploaded file

Example:
```python
GEN_QUIZ_PROMPT = """
Given the following content:
"""
{extracted_text}
"""
Generate 5 multiple-choice questions (each with 4 options and 1 correct answer) and 2 true/false questions. Return them in the following format:

[
  {
    "question": "...",
    "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "..."
  },
  ...
]
"""
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Responsibilities

Prompt logic in this folder is called by:
- `/upload-db/` route (during file upload, to generate first quiz section)
- `/quizzes/{file_id}/generate-more` (to dynamically generate more quiz sections)
- `/answers/` route (to evaluate submitted user answers)

The actual API call to Gemini is handled in `services/gemini_service.py`, while this folder holds the textual logic passed into those requests.

## üîß Future Improvements
- Add few-shot examples to the prompts to improve consistency
- Modularize prompts further to support more question types (e.g., fill-in-the-blank, open ended questions)
